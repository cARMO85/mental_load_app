        "title": "üîÆ Anticipation: Thinking Ahead",
        "research": "Research identifies anticipation as one of four core dimensions of household cognitive labour (Daminger, 2019). This involves thinking ahead to what will be needed, often before anyone else notices.",
        "what_it_means": "This is the mental work of noticing what will be needed soon and planning for it before it becomes urgent.",
        "example": "Remembering the school form is due Friday, noticing you're low on milk, planning meals for the week."
    },
    "identification": {
        "title": "üëÅÔ∏è Identification: Noticing What Needs Doing",
        "research": "Identification refers to recognising what needs to be done and breaking it down into actionable tasks (Daminger, 2019). Studies show this 'noticing work' is often gendered and invisible to those not doing it.",
        "what_it_means": "This is the work of seeing what needs to happen and defining the actual tasks involved.",
        "example": "Spotting that the bathroom needs cleaning, recognising a child needs new shoes, seeing the light bulb is out."
    },
    "decision": {
        "title": "ü§î Decision-Making: Choosing How & When",
        "research": "Decision-making includes researching options, weighing trade-offs, and coordinating schedules (Daminger, 2019). This 'project management' work is often invisible yet cognitively demanding.",
        "what_it_means": "This is about making choices for the household - which doctor, what gift, how to handle a situation.",
        "example": "Choosing which childcare, deciding what to cook, picking a birthday gift, scheduling appointments."
    },
    "monitoring": {
        "title": "üìã Monitoring: Following Up & Tracking",
        "research": "Monitoring involves tracking whether tasks are completed and following up when needed (Daminger, 2019). Research emphasises this as a particularly invisible form of cognitive labour that can remain stressful even when tasks are delegated.",
        "what_it_means": "This is the work of tracking progress, remembering deadlines, and ensuring things don't fall through the cracks.",
        "example": "Checking if forms got submitted, following up on RSVPs, tracking when bills are due, reminding about tasks."
    },
    "emotional": {
        "title": "üíù Emotional Labour: The Caring Work",
        "research": "Emotional labour includes managing feelings, maintaining relationships, and creating household harmony (Dean, Churchill and Ruppanner, 2022). Research now recognises this as cognitive work, not simply 'being nice'.",
        "what_it_means": "This is about noticing and responding to others' feelings, maintaining family relationships, and creating a positive home environment.",
        "example": "Soothing upset children, remembering to call grandma, managing conflicts, creating special moments."
