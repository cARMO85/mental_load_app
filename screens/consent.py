    ### Your data

    - **In the tool:** No data is stored. Everything stays in your browser and is deleted when you close the tab.

    ### Voluntary participation

    - You can stop at any time
    - You can skip any questions
    - No penalties for withdrawing

    ### Risks & benefits

    - **Benefits:** Increased awareness and structured conversations about mental load.

    ### Not a substitute for therapy

    This is a research tool, not clinical intervention. If you need relationship support, please seek professional help.
