        **Time commitment:** Approximately 30-40 minutes total
        
        **Activities:**
        1. **Pre-survey** (5 minutes): Complete individually before using the tool
        2. **Tool usage** (15-20 minutes): Complete the questionnaire together as a couple
        3. **Post-survey** (5-10 minutes): Complete individually after using the tool
        
        **What we're evaluating:**
